The four mini data analysis projects can be helpful for any new data analysis enthusiast learn some basic concepts. The peojects are prepared by Pranik Koirala.

Analysis 1: The dataset contains data concerning pavement durability. We have measurement of the change in rut (y) of 31 experimental asphalt pavements that were prepared under different conditions specfied by the values of five explanatory variables.

Analysis2: The Anscombe's quartet example problem. Anscombe's quartet was constructed in 1973 by statistician Francis Anscombe to illustrate the importance of plotting data before you analyze it and build your model.

Analysis3: Stepwise linear regression to investigate important variable contributing to target variable prediction. The dataset comprised of records from 109 different models of vehicles.

Analysis4: Exploratory analysis and logistic regression model training utilizing concepts like normalization, cross validation. The dataset is comprised of records from 768 different people to determine whether a given patient shows sign of diabetes. The dataset consists of information of eight attributes and a label to indiate a patient or a healthy individual
